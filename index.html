  <h1> Technology in our Everyday Life</h1>
     <p>The technology is more powerful and nothing is as good as technology at improving life. Even though this is good and on the surface, there are drawbacks also in it.
      <br>
       The technology can affect our lives on both positive and negative ways. New technologies are always changing our life much more and takes it to a new level.
     <br>
       We canâ€™t think anything about technology in the future because; we have a lot of technical things which are enough for a modern life.
     <br> 
     It will continue to change in the future because there is nothing new to develop in the future and also we have everything to do in our lives now.
     <br>
     Therefore, technology has most improved our lives through education, communication, and medical treatment.</p>

   <h2>Education:</h2>
      <p> A focus of many experiments and studies has been the use of digital technology in education.
        In order to achieve the best results, modern education needs <br> to be paired with modern technology.
         Both the instructor and the student will use the program to develop teaching and learning techniques.</p>
    <h2>Health:</h2>
       <p>  In the healthcare sector, technology has had a significant influence. Advances in diagnostic tools enable doctors to detect health issues early,
           increasing the chances
          <br> of effective treatments that can save lives. Modern medicine helps patients to treat chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension, 
           that were once debilitating
           <br> and life-threatening. Medical technology advances have expanded lifespans and enhanced the quality of life for people around the world.
